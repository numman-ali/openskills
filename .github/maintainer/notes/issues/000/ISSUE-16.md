## Intent
Prevent AGENTS usage text from triggering a `bash` call in Gemini CLI.

## Analysis
The `Bash("...")` example is misinterpreted by Gemini CLI. Updated generated usage text to plain shell invocation.

## Proposed Action
Respond noting the fix in v1.5.0; close after reporter confirmation.

## Draft Response (requires approval)
- TODO: Draft the public response.
